# Rock vs Mine Predictor :
The project is used to detect whether the object in the ocean is a rock or a mine. This prediction model can be quite useful in ships. 
Data used for this project is the sonar radiations of over 200 objects. Based on these sonar radiations, the model is able to predict whether the object is a mine or a rock.

The prediction can only have one of the two outcomes. Therefore the Logistic Regression statistical model is best suited for it.
